# rt
A backward ray tracer that takes in JSON scene files and outputs images.

## Motivation
Ever since I took a ray tracing course in college, I wanted to build one outside of the constraints of the class. I enjoy the images that ray tracers produce almost as much as I enjoy the way they're produced (as opposed to more traditional graphics engines). This project is largely a learning exercise in architecture, unit testing, and class design. I've chosen C# since it's the language I'm currently most familiar with, but I could see this slowly converting over to C++ libraries as I develop more of the project.


Thanks for stopping by!
